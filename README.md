# Pacman Game in Java

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pacman game using Java's built-in AWT/Swing graphics library. The game provides basic features such as character movement, random ghost movements, collision detection, score tracking, and game resets.

## Features
- Built with Java AWT and Swing for GUI rendering.
- Game loop for continuous gameplay.
- JFrame and JPanel for game window and rendering.
- Tilemap-based game map for layout.
- Click handlers to control Pacman movement.
- Random movement algorithm for ghost behavior.
- Collision detection between Pacman and ghosts.
- Food pellet collection and score tracking.
- Automatic game reset upon collision with ghosts.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).


## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move Pacman.
- Avoid the ghosts while collecting food pellets to score points.
- The game resets if Pacman collides with a ghost.


## Future Enhancements
- Add levels with increasing difficulty.
- Introduce power-ups to allow Pacman to eat ghosts temporarily.
- Add sound effects for movement, collisions, and eating pellets.
- Implement high-score saving.
